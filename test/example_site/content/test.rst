:summary: This is an $\alpha\omega\epsilon s \sigma m \epsilon$ markdown test.


The new plugin is :math:`\alpha\omega\epsilon s \sigma m \epsilon`, particularly
in combination with KaTeX as on this blog. It has good support for big
equations:

.. math::

    E=mc^2

A vector :math:`\vec{a}` looks beautiful. Writing
order of magnitudes with :math:`\mathcal{O}(n)` is pretty.

.. math::

    \vec{\alpha} = \vec{\beta}
