Title: Markdown test
Date: 2010-12-03 10:20
Slug: markdown-test
Summary: This is an $\alpha\omega\epsilon s \sigma m \epsilon$ markdown test.


The new plugin is $\alpha\omega\epsilon s \sigma m \epsilon$, particularly
in combination with KaTeX as on this blog. It has good support for big
equations: $$E=mc^2$$
A vector $\vec{a}$ looks beautiful. Writing
order of magnitudes with $\mathcal{O}(n)$ is pretty.
